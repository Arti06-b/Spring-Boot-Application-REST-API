CRUD REST API with Spring Boot and H2 In-Memory Database
  üìñ Project Overview
    This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST API built using Spring Boot and an H2 in-memory database. 
    It demonstrates how to structure a Spring Boot application with a clean architecture following best practices.
    The API allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on a User entity. 
    It is designed for beginners to understand the fundamentals of building REST APIs with Spring Boot.
    
üöÄ Features
CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete runs.

RESTful Endpoints: Implements REST standards for API design.

H2 In-Memory Database: Temporary database that resets every time the application restarts.

Layered Architecture: Separates Controller, Service, and Repository layers.
